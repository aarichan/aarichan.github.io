      <h5>prologue</h5>
      <p>Honestly this could be the most reckless decision that I have made. There is still a relatively deadly virus that is being spread around right now and the number of cases aren't really going down. Nothing that the government is doing right now (Joe Biden becoming president, re-joining the Paris Climate Agreement, etc.) is directly helping me not get the virus so honestly there's no good reason for me to be back on campus right?</p>


      <h5>what I knew before coming back to campus</h5>
      <p>I knew that campus life would be drastically different from how it was freshman year. I also knew that I would be at a higher risk of contracting the virus compared to being at home. I also knew that my dad would have to be spending a lot more money having me be at school than at home.</p>

      <p>But I also knew that being at home means I won't be able to see my Duke friends until late 2021 or even later. It also means that I would lose out on a quintessential experience of my life, being on a college campus and enjoying college life. Besides the tangible things, I would also feel deeply stressed and depressed being at home with the risk of my dad coming into my room any day of the week and giving me a hour+ long lecture which will eventually lead to me being told that I am too incompetent or short-sighted. Being at home would also mean my mom could enter my closed-door room at the most inconvenient time in the day and demand me to do something for her or the family. All of these things are stressors that I personally want to avoid.</p>

      <p>The pros and cons for myself is listed pretty well in the above paragraphs but also me choosing whether or not I am going back to campus can have an effect on my parent's well-being as well. I know that the entire family back home would be stressed that I could possibly catch COVID-19 at school. I promised them I would stay away from dangerous situations. I would also maintain good hygiene everyday and do as much as I can to prevent contracting the virus. I also want to video call my mom or grandma at least once a week to check up on them and report on how I was doing. As for my dad, I think the best way to make sure he doesn't worry about me is to periodically report my good grades and achievements here at school such as staying fit by running or rolling out a new feature of the startup I'm working on, Parti. Also this doesn't immediately address the health concerns he has of me being here, but I know he also cares a lot about my success in personal fitness and career related activities. Hopefully that is enough to make him not too worried about me.</p>


      <h5>(digression about mental health)</h5>
      <p>This section will just be a digression centered around the importance of mental wellbeing.</p>

      <p>This morning, I received an email from Duke detailing the tragic death of a Duke University senior living in Cary. I hate to say this but the email did not invoke any particular feeling in me. I feel like I have been numbed by the high number of suicides and deaths made known to me in the past year (yes. 4 is too high of a number!). Mental health is an important part of a person's well-being. Any sort of mental health struggles is just as lethal as cancer or a car accident. Suicides feel normalized but that entire idea is wrong. Suicides should not be normalized. It is wrong and the lasting impact of suicides for friends and family is at least 100 times worse than an accident.</p>

      <p>If you happen to be reading this and are even remotely thinking of suicide. Stop reading, go to your phone app, and text or call me. I don't care what time it is. Talk to me please.</p>

      <h5>what it actually feels being on campus (after 1 full week)</h5>
      <p>It feels great! I love my life! End of story?</p>

      <p>Okay to be honest that's literally my feeling. I haven't gotten COVID (yet). I hang out and study with my friends every other day. I got meals with other good friends I haven't seen in like 9 months and just talked about our lives and caught up with each other. I feel like my days have become more productive as well. At home, I would wake up at 10am everyday and go back to bed after a class. I would also put off studying and doing homework until after dinner at around 6:00pm and I would stay up until 1:00am some days working or studying. At school, I force myself to wake up at 7:30am everyday and go on a mile run to start off every day. I start doing homework early every week because Andy's positive study habits rubbed off on me. I feel overall much more alive and happy being in an environment where other people are leading similar lives compared to mine.</p>

      <p>Not everyone has the same experiences as me though. A good friend of mine I met last year came to school for a couple days but ultimately decided to fly back home. He felt like the modified on-campus environment isn't what he hoped for and wasn't worth the price. I'm happy for him. At the end of the day, different people have different perspectives on the current situation. The golden rule is to always to make decisions that make yourself happy without negatively impacting others. I'll be sad that we no longer can grab a meal and talk in-person but we said we will keep in touch over discord/zoom. I will definitely try to proactively make plans to meet up over the semester. I will look forward to his return next semester.</p>

      <h5>epilogue</h5>
      <p>I'm happy with my current situation. I hope that my friends and family are not too worried about this. I hope that everyone can move forward and continue to make strides in their perspective lives because I will keep making strides in my personal life here on campus.</p>
