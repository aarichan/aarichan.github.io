      <h5>prologue</h5>
      <p>This is my first blog entry. I wrote the contents of this entry at 1:20AM on December 14, 2020. Honestly this is just an entry for me to test the formatting of my blogs pI have been through at least 3 iterations of this website in the past 6 months. Originally I planned to have different pages for different sections of my website. Then after working on the website, I ended up with a bazillion files I needed to organize. I ended up scrapping that site to work on a one page design. The one page design was fine but it wasn't scalable at all. In order to view added blog entries or any other content, I had to scroll and scroll forever. 
      *Scrapped* 
      So now I'm back to square one: multiple pages with minimal content on a page.ortion of the website. Nothing here is really thought-provoking. I just needed to see if the formatting would cut off text or look bad on mobile devices.</p>
      <h5>why I am procrastinating</h5>
      <p>I was initially busy with school work. Then I was working on side projects. Then I lost motivation to work on the personal website because I was so burnt out. Now I'm finally making good progress but I'm kinda tired since it's 1:55AM.</p>

      <h5>epilogue</h5>
      Will my website change in the near future? Probably. It's probably because as a perfectionist, I can never finish a design I like. I'm always searching for an alternative, a better design... 
      And that's why I can't ever finish anything.
